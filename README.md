# dab-slideshow
Make smarter DAB slideshows!

## What does it do?
dab-slideshow is a project designed to recreate DAB slideshows such as Bayern 1's slideshow, which includes now playing information.

## How does it work? 
dab-slideshow uses the Azuracast API (currently) to grab song information, I may create a seperate branch which pulls from Icecast2 instead in the future.
